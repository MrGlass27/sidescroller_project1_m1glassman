Hello professor santore, 
This is the galga like side scroller we were supposed to make for project 1 in the 2d game design course.
I am not sure if the requirments have been fully met by this game as i have not had acess to the course materials website, I procastinated too much and was scared to ask.
However im sure this game covers most of the criteria for the project.
You use the left and right arrow keys to move the ship left and right respectively and the space bar is used to fire the projectile.
For every ship you destroy you get one point.
When you reach 30 points the game stops and a congargulatory message apears in the top left corner.
